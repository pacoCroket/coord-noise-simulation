# Noise2LED - by Paco Croket

The coordinate-noise simulation tool helps to design LED/pixel patterns on a 2D space, test colors from mapped Perlin noise values, and finally output the coordinates in custom formats.

## Usage

The idea here is to paint the position of your LEDs in ther order and then get an custom output to copy into your code. These can be mapped to 2D or 3D noise values.

1. Upload a picture of your LED project showing all the LEDs. Keep in mind their order.

2. Following the actual id of your LEDs, progessively mark their position with the paint tool. Adjust the LED distance and use the line tool to cover large straight areas

3. Grab the LEDs to fine tune their position. Use the erase tool to remove an LED. Notice that
   the id of the LEDs is automatically kept continuous.
   
4. Copy the output from the outout area into your code. Set the output scaling to fit your
   microcontroller needs. A value of 255 corresponds to 8-bit values, great for Arduino projects.


Here is an example of how you could implement the noise feature with C++. More details in
<a href="https://github.com/pacoCroket/arduino-neopixel/blob/master/mandala1/mandala1.ino" target="_blank">this full project</a>.

```#include <FastLED.h>
const PROGMEM uint8_t ledsArray[NUM_LEDS][2] = {{220, 68}, {228, 73}, {235, 77}, {243, 81}};
CRGB leds[NUM_LEDS];

void setup()
{
    LEDS.addLeds<LED_TYPE, LED_PIN, COLOR_ORDER>(leds, NUM_LEDS);
    // Initialize our coordinates to some random values
    x = random8();
    y = random8();
    z = random8();
}

for (uint8_t i = 0; i < NUM_LEDS; i++)
{
    uint16_t xoffset = pgm_read_byte(&(ledsArray[i][0])) * scale;
    uint16_t yoffset = pgm_read_byte(&(ledsArray[i][1])) * scale;

    uint8_t index = inoise8(x + xoffset, y + yoffset, z);
    uint8_t bri = inoise8(x + yoffset, y + xoffset, z); // another random point for brightness

    CRGB color = ColorFromPalette(currentPalette, index, bri);
    leds1[i] = color;

    z += speed;
    x -= speed;
}
```
